<h2> <strong>School news</strong> this week.</h2>
<p>Congratulations als goes out to Braden Loose who, with his round of 43, finished 3rd overall at the JV City Meet yesterday at Duck Creek Golf Course.</p>

<p>The letter below was sent to Mr. Brosius from a West High graduate about his programming classes. What a ringing endorsement. Go WEST!</p>

<p>Good Afternoon,

Hey how are you?  I just wanted to inform you on how great of a teacher you were. Over the summer i was able to attend the Google internship for 3 weeks and that was a breeze for me due to your class. Also Iâ€™m currently attending Clark Atlanta with a major of computer science and let me just say they brought me in here letting me take junior programming classes because of how much knowledge I came with from your class. They are also letting me become a tutor for a freshman and sophomore programming class. Thank you so much again!</p>
